# Scala_Coursera_progAssign

This course is wonderful although a little bit hard to understand at first. I started by looking at the instructor's notes and the codes written by others. 

Doing the programming assignments is a lot fun! I kept on trying all new methods I've learned and I began to see the beauty of functional programming.
